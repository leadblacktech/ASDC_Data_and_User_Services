# Contributing Guide

These recommendations are based on previous notebook reviews and revisions.

*This contributing guide is a draft, and still under active, open development.*

### Style Guidelines

The following are recommended and/or enforced via the CI/CD workflow:
- Use `ruff` for linting and formatting.
- Wherever possible and appropriate, move inline comments into notebook Markdown cells.
- Wherever possible and appropriate, replace static references to local files with code that will programmatically pull data files when running a notebook.

### Content Guidelines

Ensure each notebook contains, at a minimum:
- An **Overview** section in the header
- An **Author/Affiliation** section in the header

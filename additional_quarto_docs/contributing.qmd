*This contributing guide is a draft, and still under active, open development.*

### Style Guidelines

The following are recommended and/or enforced via the CI/CD workflow:

- Use `ruff` for linting and formatting.
- Wherever possible and appropriate, move inline comments into notebook Markdown cells.
- Wherever possible and appropriate, replace static references to local files with code that will programmatically pull data files when running a notebook.

### Content Guidelines

Ensure each notebook contains, at a minimum:

- A quarto header with an auto-generated "last published" date included
- A Markdown header section with:
  - A **Summary** or **Overview** block
  - A **Prerequisites** block
  - A **Notebook Author/Affiliation** block
- Numbered sections that use Markdown hash symbols (#) for headings

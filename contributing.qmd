## Contribution Style Guide

Based on previous notebook reviews and revisions,
the following are recommended and/or enforced via the CI/CD workflow:
- Use `ruff` for linting and formatting.
- Wherever possible and appropriate, move inline comments into notebook Markdown cells.
- Wherever possible and appropriate, replace static references to local files with code that will programmatically pull data files when running a notebook.
